            I love and enjoy the not-so-little thrill of seeing my code finally
            work after hours of trying. I'm curious, playful with ideas, and
            always up for learning something new, preferably with a good
            playlist and snacks close by!

          <h2>Improvement Area</h2>
          <p>
            One area I'm still building confidence in is handling complex
            JavaScript logic and debugging issues when things don’t work as
            expected. Sometimes I understand the concept but struggle to apply
            it smoothly in real projects. I'm learning to be more patient with
            the process and to see challenges as opportunities to grow rather
            than setbacks.

            Hey you! Look how far you've come! Remember the
            days when everything felt confusing, and you weren't sure if you
            were doing enough? You kept going anyway. You chose progress over perfection. I am super proud of us! 사랑해
